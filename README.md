This example demonstrates a simple function that performs an arithmetic operation and returns a value. It highlights fundamental JavaScript concepts such as function definition, parameters, return statements, variable assignment, and console output.

 Code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 3);
console.log("The result is: " + result);

 Overview

The add function is defined with two parameters: a and b.

The function returns the sum of the two input values.

add(5, 3) is called.

The function calculates 5 + 3.

The value 8 is returned.

The result is stored in the variable result.

The console outputs:

The result is: 8
